# Flight rules for R

This has been inspired by
[k88hudson](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules)

Where she quotes:

Flight rules are a
[guide for astronauts](http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/news/columbia/fr_generic.pdf)
(now, people using R) about what to do when things go wrong (when you
need something done).

>  *Flight Rules* are the hard-earned body of knowledge recorded in
>  manuals that list, step-by-step, what to do if X occurs, and
>  why. Essentially, they are extremely detailed, scenario-specific
>  standard operating procedures. [...]

> NASA has been capturing our missteps, disasters and solutions since
> the early 1960s, when Mercury-era ground teams first started
> gathering "lessons learned" into a compendium that now lists
> thousands of problematic situations, from engine failure to busted
> hatch handles to computer glitches, and their solutions.

&mdash; Chris Hadfield, *An Astronaut's Guide to Life*.
